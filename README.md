## ADM-HMW1
#the ADM-HMW-sub contains the pdf of all submissions, as you may notice I'm so dumb that I used Pypy language at the very beginning, which until 3 weeks ago I didn't even know about its existence, sorry for that. The code works and it passes the test anyway.
I've mentioned in the code of the excercise if I had to check or consult blogs/forum/guides/discussions to understand some tasks. Hope everything's fine.
